# SQL-Query-in-Northwind-Database  

This project focuses on **executing SQL queries** in the **Northwind database using MySQL**. The queries cover various SQL concepts, including filtering, aggregation, and subqueries.  

## Project Overview  

In this project, I explored the **Northwind database** by writing and executing SQL queries in **MySQL** to extract meaningful insights. The queries include:  

- **Basic SQL Operations**  
  - `SELECT`, `FROM`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`  

- **Filtering & Pattern Matching**  
  - `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`  

- **Aggregate Functions & Calculations**  
  - `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`  
  - Creating **aliases** and aggregating new columns  

- **String Functions in MySQL**  
  - `CONCAT_WS()`, `CONCAT()`  

- **Advanced Queries**  
  - **Subqueries** for extracting data from nested results
